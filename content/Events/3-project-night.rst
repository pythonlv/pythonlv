Come work on projects, get programming help, help others, and hang out.

Python Latvia Workshops provide are freeform, generally unstructured events,
providing the opportunity for developers to work
together, mentor each other, connect socially, teach, learn, or do whatever else
it is developers want to do together.

It's a great way to build the Python/developer community, by allowing
members to meet and interact in whatever way they find most beneficial.
