Find projects to hack on
========================

- `Wheres the best place to find project to hack on`_ - reddit discussion on
  where to find hacking projects.
- `Kindling projects`_ - a compilation of kindling project by Ned Batchelder. 
  Kindling projects are simple enough that a new learner can take them on, 
  but with possibilities for extension and creativity. Large enough that there 
  isn't one right answer, but designed to be hacked on by a learner simply to 
  flex their muscles.
