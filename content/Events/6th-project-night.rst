As usual on every 2nd and 4th weeks wednesday we're having a Project Night. 
What does it mean for those who have never attended?
Project Night (or #PyNight) is a free-form event where everyone of us can start his own pet-project or work on existing 
projects - whether from our own or any other Python (but not strictly only Python!) project.
For example some of us are working on ReactX in Python, others are exploring web micro-frameworks and 
others are exploring different topic every Project Night. This is also great platform to dive into new tool/paradigm/etc
with others willing to give advice. Most important thing every Project Night shares - collaboration! 

To make collaboration and communication easier - join us on our chat_.

This time some us will be working on:

- zrks_ will try to make simple pdf document highlighter
- abele_ will continue to work on ReactiveX_ in Python

Need some project ideas? How about:

Find projects to hack on
========================

- `Wheres the best place to find project to hack on`_ - reddit discussion on
  where to find hacking projects.
- `Kindling projects`_ - a compilation of kindling project by Ned Batchelder. 
  Kindling projects are simple enough that a new learner can take them on, 
  but with possibilities for extension and creativity. Large enough that there 
  isn't one right answer, but designed to be hacked on by a learner simply to 
  flex their muscles.
