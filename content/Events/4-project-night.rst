After struggling to get new and interesting talks form our monthly meetups we
have decided to ditch this format. Instead we will have a Project Night twice a
month. This gives us a chance to spend more time together doing things we love
and prepare occasional top notch talk. Have different opinion? Come hang in the
chat_.

For those who don't know, Project Nights are freeform, generally unstructured 
events, providing the opportunity for developers to work together, mentor each 
other, connect socially, teach, learn, or do whatever else it is developers want 
to do together.

It's a great way to build the Python/developer community, by allowing members to 
meet and interact in whatever way they find most beneficial.

Need some project ideas? How about:

Find projects to hack on
========================

- `Where's the best place to find project to hack on`_ - reddit discussion on
  where to find hacking projects.
- `Kindling projects`_ - a compilation of kindling project by Ned Batchelder. 
  Kindling projects are simple enough that a new learner can take them on, 
  but with possibilities for extension and creativity. Large enough that there 
  isn't one right answer, but designed to be hacked on by a learner simply to 
  flex their muscles.
- `MakeRiga Hacking competition`_ - prepare for hacking competition.

Agenda
======
- 19:00 - Meet and greet
- 19:15 - Programming
- 21:00 - Q&A, evening retrospective
- 21:20 - **Chill**

**Take your friends with you, and make new ones. Tweet @pythonlatvia #python
