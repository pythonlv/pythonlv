After a short break we're back with another #PyNight!
And that means that everyone who is interested in python can join us and make and/or explore some topic/project. You certainly can take some ideas with you - but if you don't know exactly what you want to explore/make then as usual you'll be invited to join someone who already knows exactly what he wants to do.

For example, this time you can join exploration of pygame_ module with intention remake well known game or explore how to configure Vagrant_ + Docker_ to run Django_ app.


If you have any questions and/or suggestions - join us on our chat_.


Need some project ideas? How about:

Find projects to hack on
========================

- `Wheres the best place to find project to hack on`_ - reddit discussion on
  where to find hacking projects.
- `Kindling projects`_ - a compilation of kindling project by Ned Batchelder. 
  Kindling projects are simple enough that a new learner can take them on, 
  but with possibilities for extension and creativity. Large enough that there 
  isn't one right answer, but designed to be hacked on by a learner simply to 
  flex their muscles.
