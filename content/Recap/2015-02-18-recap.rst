Our first monthly workshop took place at `The Mill`_. This time cookies and
green tea were on the house.

In hindsight, this event should have been called a Project Night. Because these
events will be free flow and won't necessarily fit a workshop format. And Project
Night sound much much cooler than Workshop.

Projects
--------

Results of this workshop are available at GitHub:

- `daGrevis/pong-py`_ - old school game of pong done in Brython_ and runs in
  the browser. Worked on by `daGrevis`_ and `siers`_.
- `abele/whatsmyrank`_ - table tennis ranking web application, done by `abele`_
  and `zrks`_.

Discussion
----------
- `Patterns Enhance Craft`_ three articles by Kent Beck.
- Learning NLP from tutorials:

  - `Part 1: For Beginners - Bag of Words`_
  - `Part 2: Word Vectors`_
  - `Part 3: More Fun With Word Vectors`_
  - `How to build and run your first deep learning network`_

Upcoming events
---------------
- March 4th 19:00, `Python on smartphones`_ meetup at `TechHub Riga`_.
- March 18th 19:00, `Project night`_ at `The Mill`_.

Have something to say? `Propose a talk`_.
