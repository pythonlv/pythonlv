We took it to the bar again with lesser-than-usual number of participants and discussed a number of topics, both software-related and not.

Software things
===============

- abele_ talked about the need to brush up frontend development skills and the `pains of bringing them up to date`_ in 2016, with SangSatori_ agreeing on the crazy state of JavaScript front-end tooling - bringing up the discussion on the sustainability and long-term landscape of frontend development, including the current use of `Yeoman generators`_.
- Links between the design of frameworks and software architecture in context of design of Python & JavaScript was another topic, concluding that it pays off to embrace the `design of the language`_ when `building Pythonic software`_.
- SangSatori_ had a few thoughts to share on the differences between `Angular and React`_ in how they approach solving the frontend problems, benefits of using `Flexbox`_ and the direction of TypeScript and Dart languages and `web components`_.
- abele_ recalled a number of `great resources`_ on software architecture for writing clean, expressive Python code that makes sense.

Non-software discussions
========================

- abele_ had plenty of insight and advice for SangSatori_ on eating the right things the right way and how it affects physical and mental state of being, how not all calories are created equal and his experience with `Ketogenic diet`_ in context of low-carb, high-fat food intake.
- We also shared stories and personal experiences on the importance of mental well-being and doing the right things for one's mental health.
