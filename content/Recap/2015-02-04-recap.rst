Wednesday February 4th, monthly meetup took place at `TechHub Riga`_. Pizza and
cookies were on EGlobal, who have bunch of pythonistas here in Latvia.

To spark new ideas and get more together, we have decided to have our
`monthly workshop`_ at `The Mill`_.

NLTK
----
Alberts Pumpurs (@pumours_) gave a great overview of `NLTK`_ library in Python.
He has shared `presentation here`_ . If you squint, then you can see some code
examples there.

`NLTK`_ is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human
language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora_ and lexical
resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for
classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic
reasoning. Good starting point would be `NLTK Wiki`_ and `NLTK online book`_
containing a lot of examples.

When working with Latvian language material, you have to create your own lexical
resources, like `Latvian positive and negative sentiment wods`_. See `Adding a
Corpus`_ documentation for details.

To fine-tune and choose sample size consult this `scikit-learn algorithm
cheat-sheet`_

SQLAlchemy
----------
Evening closed out with discussion about `SQLAlchemy sessions`_ when you want to
reuse code between interfaces like Flask_ and console application. In this
use case `Flask-SQLAlchemy`_ extension won't cut it, you have to roll your own
code. If not careful they they can lead to serous bugs like sharing 
information between users. So before writing code involving sessions, RTFM_ and 
consult experts. If you are one of the experts, then `propose a talk`_, we would
like to hear your opinion.

Upcoming events
---------------
- February 18th 19:00, first ever Python Latvia `monthly workshop`_ at 
  `The Mill`_.
- March 4th 19:00 `next meetup`_ at `TechHub Riga`_.

Have something to say? `Propose a talk`_.
